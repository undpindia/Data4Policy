# Data4Policy 

## Background 

UNDP has partnered with the Government of Telangana to jointly initiate the NextGenGov ‘Data for Policy’ initiative on Food Systems. The aim is to incorporate anticipatory governance models for future-fit food systems in Telangana using data-driven policymaking tools and ecosystem-driven approaches. UNDP is keen on augmenting learning capabilities, increasing the predictive or anticipatory capacity to feed-in to evidence-driven policies in the state, and create radical traceability and transparency across the system from producers to consumers by building provenance documentation around food that can help build trust in the system at the same time nurture sustainable and healthy practices. The goal is to design, develop and demonstrate anticipatory governance models for food systems in Telangana using digital public goods and community-centric approaches to strengthen data-driven policy making in the state.
